Heylo, I'm Nitin. I'm a compiler engineer in the day, and a dependent type theorist by night.
It's nice to meet you, mysterious reader!

I'm rather new to compilers -- right now, I work in code generation, but who knows where I'll
be a year from now. I dream of building an optimizing compiler for Gimmick, my own dependently
typed language, but the actualization has been continually forestalled by perfectionist tendencies.
I'm not too worried about that right now -- there's no deadline on this project, and no reason
to hasten it at the expense of learning and quality. Perhaps I'll need to reconsider that in
a year or so, but for now, I know far too little to make anything meaningful.

On the compilers side, I have much to learn before I can make informed choices -- my two weeks
at SiFive have taught me that I know far less than I thought. But that just means there's 
plenty to learn. I'm rather disappointed that I don't have much to say on this front yet,
but that will change in the next year.

In terms of the type theory, I'm exploring what I call the Calculus of Paraconstructions,
a version of the Calculus of Constructions extended with dual intuitionistic connectives.
Aaron Stump is working (far more earnestly than I) on similar calculi, though as far as I'm 
aware, he hasn't scaled it to dependent types yet. The hope is that dual intuitionism will 
provide a nice framework upon which we can define coinductive types.

I have a lot of hopes for the next few years. I want to prove myself deserving of the moniker
"compiler engineer". I want to show that I can continue working in type theory without
needing a PhD. I want to learn to dance, parkour, sing. 

In a year, I'll update this again. By then, some of those hopes will have materialized 
into history. I can't wait to see what that'll look like. :)
